### Admin Persona Frontend

This repository contains the frontend implementation for the admin persona of my non-monetary donation application. I focused on developing the frontend functionalities required for admins to manage the platform effectively.

#### Implemented Features:
- **Login for Admins**: I implemented secure access to the platform using a username and password.
- **View Organizations and Donors Lists**: Admins can view lists of organizations and donors to assess partnership opportunities and coordinate volunteer efforts efficiently.
- **Review Submissions**: I developed functionalities for admins to review submissions from organizations and donors to ensure credibility and alignment with platform standards.
- **Manage Requests**: I enabled admins to accept or reject requests from organizations and donors, ensuring only qualified and credible participants are engaged.
- **Password Management**: I enabled admins to change their passwords for enhanced account security.

Additionally, I implemented functionalities for viewing registered organizations, searching, filtering, and viewing detailed information about organizations to facilitate effective collaboration.
